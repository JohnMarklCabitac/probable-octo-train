  <h2>Calle Crisologo, Vigan</h2>
  <p>
    Travel back in time as you stroll along the streets of Calle Crisologo in Vigan as part of your Ilocos itinerary. This 16th-century town, a UNESCO World Heritage Site and a popular tourist spot in the Philippines, quietly boasts old-world charm and Spanish colonial architecture and is the top attraction in Vigan, Ilocos tours and one of the top historical landmarks in the Philippines. 

The town famous for its Calle Crisologo tour has successfully managed to preserve the historic district where you can still find calesas (horse-drawn carriages). Sample the famous and delicious Ilocos empanada, and walk along cobbled streets lined up with souvenir shops selling pottery and Abel Iloko weaves, among the many things to see and do when in Vigan.

  <h2>Kayangan Lake, Coron, Palawan</h2>
  <p>
    Undoubtedly one of the most photographed and iconic destinations in the Philippines is Kayangan Lake in Coron, Palawan. Going on a Kayangan Lake Coron tour will allow you to see its lagoon that is a dreamy mix of blues and greens glistening on a bright, sunny day. It should definitely be on your Coron Palawan itinerary.

  <h2>Mayon Volcano, Albay, Bicol</h2>
  <p>
    As soon as your flight lands at the airport in Bicol International Airport of Albay province, the world’s most perfect volcanic cone, and the most active volcano in the Philippines, greets you with its majesty. Mayon Volcano is one of the most beautiful places to visit in the Philippines and is a top attraction in any Bicol tour.

Its sheer beauty (the name Mayon comes from the Bicolano word ‘magayon,’ which means beautiful) hides a violent core, with past eruptions that flattened several towns.

  <h2>Nacpan Beach, El Nido</h2>
  <p>
    El Nido in Palawan is most famous for its paradise-like islands and lagoons, but a 45-minute ride away through a land tour from its main town takes you to another idyllic destination: Nacpan Beach. 

Island hopping escapades in El Nido including a visit to El Nido Big Lagoon and other top Palawan beaches should not be missed. But after a jam-packed day of visiting coves, white-sand beaches in El Nido, limestone cliffs, and other El Nido Palawan tourist spots a trip to relaxing Nacpan Beach is highly recommended and deserves a spot in your itinerary of things to see and do in El Nido.

  <h2>Rizal Park, Manila</h2>
  <p>
    Many travelers skip Manila and make their way to the Philippines' other islands but a day or two in the country’s capital to go on Manila tours is still highly recommended, especially for those looking for the best places in the Philippines for a family vacation.

The hustle and bustle aside, Manila features a lot of tourist spots of historical landmarks in the Philippines. One of which is the Rizal Park, or more commonly known as Luneta.

  <h2>Tubbataha Reef, Palawan</h2>
  <p>
    Tubbataha Reef is regarded as one of the top diving spots in the Philippines, and perhaps, the world. Located at the heart of the Sulu Sea, it is considered a center of marine biodiversity and a haven not just for divers but marine conservationists as well. The only way to get to this marine sanctuary is through a liveaboard vessel from Puerto Princesa, Palawan. 

The access may be challenging, but it is probably what is keeping the Tubbataha Reefs Natural Park teeming with some of the most unique underwater life in the world. It is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site and was nominated as part of the “New Seven Wonders of the Natural World.”
